Welcome to my GitHub repository where I've shared three exciting projects that I've worked on. Each project is located in its respective folder within this repository. Feel free to explore and learn more about each project.

## Project 1: Simple Chatbot Using Python If-Else

Folder: `simple-chatbot`

In this project, I built a rule-based chatbot using Python with if-else statements. The chatbot can engage in conversations, answer questions, and provide information based on predefined rules. It's a basic but educational exploration into the world of natural language processing.

Feel free to navigate to each project's respective folder to access the source code, documentation, and any additional resources. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. I hope you find these projects interesting and insightful!

## Project 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax AI Algorithm

Folder: `tic-tac-toe-minimax-ai`

Here, I created a Tic-Tac-Toe AI using the minimax algorithm. This AI plays optimally and always aims for the best possible outcome in the game. The implementation includes a command-line interface for playing against the AI or watching it play against itself.

## Project 3: Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

Folder: `content-based-recommendation`

In this project, I implemented a content-based movie recommendation system. It suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The system uses machine learning techniques to analyze movie features and provide personalized recommendations.


Happy coding! ðŸš€
